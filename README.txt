Created a PowerBi Dashboard that used data related to Debit Collections Agents, including information on agents, calls, rejections, and other factors. This assessment was open to interpretation, and the data was somewhat challenging to understand because I had limited prior knowledge in this specific area. Despite this, I managed to identify important patterns in the data. As a result of my performance in this assessment, I was offered a job as a Data Analyst specializing in Debit Collections.
